# Champions-League-Knockout-Stages
Consider the results from the UEFA Champions League knockout stages (Round of 16, Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals) from competition origin to present.
Do teams gain a competitive advantage when they play the first leg of a knockout tie at home versus playing the second leg at home? 
Are there specific teams for which this does or does not apply?
When teams from different time zones are drawn, does one team gain a particular advantage?
Is there a conditional effect as teams progress throughout the knockout stages? (ie. if a team plays the first leg at home in the round of 16 and advances, do that team have a different likelihood of advancing if they again host the first leg of the quarter-finals?
Has this advantage remained consistent throughout the competition's existence?
